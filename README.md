# Algo-Trading-Project

Created a matching engine for different types of trading orders. (Orders_Matching-Engine.py) \n
Different classes for each orders were created, and a matching engine class was made to handle the different orders.
The matching engine keeps all the unfilled orders in ask and bid books, and matches every new order to the previous ones.
